# VacuumWorld

VacuumWorld is a multi-agent platform written in Python 3 that simulates cleaning robots moving around a grid to collect pieces of dirt that either were there from the beginning of the simulation, or were dropped by a user actor (also running around the grid) during the simulation.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/dicelab-rhul/vacuumworld/wiki) for the full documentation.
